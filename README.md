# LFF-student-manager #
This is a student management system for the Living Faith Fellowship Ministry Training School


a. The title of your site and a link to the URL where it is deployed

https://lff-student-manager.herokuapp.com

b. Describe what your website does

This is a student management site specifically designed for my church's classes.  It allows 
students and various types of class administrators to view a student's progress.  Different rolls
can be assigned to each user allowing them to participate in classes, TA classes, teach classes, or be an administrative 
secretary for a class, or an administrative secretary over all classes.

c. List the features you implemented and explain why you chose those features to implement

This is hard to explain as a list of features because of how this site works.  The central component of this site
is the student page.  Students can use the page to see which assignments they have or haven't turned in and what the due
date for each assignment is.  Administrators of various kinds can also access the student page to report interactions with
students and update the assignments.

d. Walk someone through the standard user flow for the website

You sign-up and log-in. If you are new, you can add a class.  Once added you can view your status in the class.
If you are a secretary you can add students to classes, assign students to TAs, and assign TAs to classes.
TAs and SAs can view a students status in a class and add comments.

e. Keep the API in there, and if you have anything to say about the API then add some notes

f. Identify the technology stack used to create your website

I used Flask, SQLAlchemy/Jinja, Bcrypt, WTForm, and Bootstrap.


g. Include anything else that you feel is important to share

There is more I'd like to add to this site to make it fully functional. This includes: adding an ability for 
the head administrator to add and remove Bible quotes from the rotation, Allowing downloading/submitting of assignments
to/from the site, archiving of classes, streamline assignment adding, allowing access to online lectures, more student analytics, and more.
